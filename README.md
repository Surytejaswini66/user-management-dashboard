Explanation of Components
components/UserForm
This component is responsible for rendering the form used to add or edit a user's details. It is reusable and accepts initialData (user details) and an onSubmit function to handle form submission.

index.js: Contains the component logic for rendering the user form.
index.css: Contains the styling for the UserForm component.
components/ErrorBoundary
This component is used to catch errors in the application and display a fallback UI when an error occurs.

index.js: Contains the logic for error handling and rendering the fallback UI.
components/UserList
This component is responsible for rendering the list of users, displaying their details, and providing actions such as Edit and Delete.

index.js: Contains the logic for displaying users, handling actions like editing and deleting, and pagination.
index.css: Contains the styling for the UserList component.
pages/AddEditUser
This page contains the form used for adding or editing a user's details. It fetches the initialData and renders the UserForm component, passing the necessary props for both adding and editing users.

index.js: Contains the logic for adding or editing users, including form submission handling.
index.css: Contains the styling for the Add/Edit user page.
api/api.js
Contains API calls for interacting with the backend to fetch and update users.

api.js: Defines functions like fetching users, adding a new user, and updating existing user data.
Challenges Faced and Potential Improvements
Challenges:
Managing State for Add/Edit: Ensuring that the correct data is loaded for editing and adding a new user was initially tricky, but using useEffect with id resolved this.
Form Validation: Although not yet fully implemented, adding proper form validation for input fields (like email format, required fields, etc.) would improve user experience.
Potential Improvements:
Form Validation: Implement better form validation to ensure that the user input is correct before submission.
User Authentication: Add authentication and authorization features for managing user access.
User Search: Introduce a search feature to easily find users by name or other attributes.
Styling: Enhance the user interface with better CSS or introduce a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI) for a more modern design.
